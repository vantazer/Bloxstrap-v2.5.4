Addressing usability problems with Bloxstrap v2.5.4
pizzaboxer edited this page on Jun 12 Â· 15 revisions
Bloxstrap development has completely halted for the past few months, and it will continue to be that way for a while, as I don't currently have time to be working on this. Therefore, I can't update information or functionality that really needs updating.

This should address all the major pain points before you start using it. Ignore any information given in the menu that may conflict with what's stated below.

Don't touch the FastFlag Editor unless you know what you're doing. (more info)
Don't set your framerate limit to anything higher than 240. Though you may still encounter issues, including but not limited to: increased network latency, and crashes when teleporting between games. In which case, set it to zero, which will recap it at 60. (more info)
If you are choosing a preferred lighting technology, keep in mind that you may encounter lighting issues in games. (more info)
The option to use old material textures does not work anymore (same goes with any texture-removing configs). Please do not complain about it not working. (more info)
Multi-instance launching will be removed in the next version. Don't depend on it for anything. (more info)
Enabling the "disable desktop app" mod will result in a crash message being shown every time you try to exit Roblox through the in-game menu. This will be fixed in the next version.
